= 1.1.8 =

Release Date: April 26, 2019

* Overview
	* Contact Forms could still be submitted to Flamingo even when the reCaptcha was not being clicked or interacted with.
		We've hook into before Contact Form 7 does their Flamingo submission and removed the hook if 1) There's a reCaptcha on the form and 2) no reCaptcha verification was found in the submitted data.]
		This should prevent the multitude of spam posts being saved in Flamingo.
		Thanks to @scits to bringing this issue to our attention!

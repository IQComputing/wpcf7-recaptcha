This is to keep track of all changes the plugin undertakes. The readme.txt should only contain the most recent 3.

= 1.1.9 =

Release Date: May 14, 2019

* Overview
	* Added option to allow user to choose which website to pull the reCaptcha resources from.
		The choices are google.com or recaptcha.net. These are for situations or countries that specifically block Google and prevent our reCaptcha from appearing.
		
* Code Changes
	* Updated recaptcha-v2.php file to switch out the recaptcha source URLs.
	* Updated reCaptcha noscript to look nicer and function better.
		* We've left styling the noscript reCaptcha up to themes and developers.
	* Added private method to handle saving settings: IQFix_WPCF7_Deity::save_recaptcha_settings()
	* Added public static method to ensure my own sanity: IQFix_WPCF7_Deity::verify_recaptcha_source()
		* Makes sure that at every point our source is either google.com or recaptcha.net

= 1.1.8 =

Release Date: April 26, 2019

* Overview
	* Contact Forms could still be submitted to Flamingo even when the reCaptcha was not being clicked or interacted with.
		We've hook into before Contact Form 7 does their Flamingo submission and removed the hook if 1) There's a reCaptcha on the form and 2) no reCaptcha verification was found in the submitted data.]
		This should prevent the multitude of spam posts being saved in Flamingo.
		Thanks to @scits to bringing this issue to our attention!
		
* Files Added
	* wpcf7-recaptcha/flamingo.php
		* Only gets included and processed whenever Flamingo is detected to be installed and active.

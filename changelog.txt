== Changelog Archive ==

This is to keep track of all changes the plugin undertakes. The readme.txt should only contain the most recent 3.

= 1.4.4 =

Release Date: September 09, 2023

* Overview
	* Tested and updated to support WordPress 6.3: Lionel

= 1.4.1 =

Release Date: July 29, 2022

* Overview
	* Fixed issue with validation error message not appearing on submission.
		Contact Form 7 updated their validation JS.

* Code Changes
	* Added 'data-name="recaptcha"' to the wpcf7 control recaptcha output in recaptcha-v2.php LN 135.
		Validation JS expect both the data-name and class "wpcf7-form-control-wrap" to work properly.

= 1.4.0 =

Release Date: June 01, 2022

* Overview
	* Updated "Tested up to" version for WordPress 6.0 branch.

= 1.3.9 =

Release Date: April 13, 2022

* Overview
	* Used the `wp_is_block_theme()` to conditionally check if Google ReCaptcha should be enqueued globally.
		If false, the script will load whenever the shortcode is called and only enqueue on pages where it's used.
		WordPress should detect this and late enqueue it into the footer.
	* FSE Themes will still need to use Google ReCpatha script globally until there is an easier way to detect if a script
		should be used or start supporting late enqueues.

* Code Changes
	* Added conditional for `wp_is_block_theme()`: recaptcha-v2.php LN 87
	* Re-added the inline enqueue check to shortcode callback: recaptcha-v2.php LN 110

= 1.3.8 =

Release Date: March 07, 2022

* Overview
	* Added new filter hook to allow developers to filter the global reCaptcha locale.

* Code Changes
	* New filter `wpcf7_recaptcha_locale` with the passed Site Locale in recaptcha-v2.php

= 1.3.7 =

Release Date: January 03, 2022

* Happy New Year!
* Overview
	* User @gerhardfasol reported an issue of the reCaptcha not appearing in the new Full Site Editing feature of TwentyTwentyTwo theme.
		FSE not longer allows late calls to `wp_enqueue_script()` function and expects all scripts to be added via the `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook.
		We have removed the late function call in favor of the hook which seems to work for FSE and backwards compatibility.

= 1.3.6 =

Release Date: November 29, 2021

* Overview
	* Applied `wpcf7_form_tag` filter to ensure ReCaptcha always has a basic name of "recaptcha".

= 1.2.4 =

Release Date: December 23, 2019

* Overview

	* Added constant checks against the Contact Form 7 constants. This will ensure the plugin does not break should those change or be removed in future versions of Contact Form 7. Future-proofing.

		We've hook into before Contact Form 7 does their Flamingo submission and removed the hook if 1) There's a reCaptcha on the form and 2) no reCaptcha verification was found in the submitted data.]
